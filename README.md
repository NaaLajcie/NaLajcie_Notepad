**The script allows players to use a notebook to create, store, and read notes. It utilizes animations and in-game objects to provide a realistic experience related to writing and reading notes. The system also supports adding images and securing notes with a password.**

# Features:
## Creating a Note:
- The player can open the notebook (using the "notepad" item) and enter the note's content, an optional image, and a password.
It supports various options, such as text input, adding an image URL, setting a password to secure the note, and selecting the number of note copies.
## Reading a Note:
- The player can read a note (using the "notepad_sheet" item). If the note is secured, a password will be required to access it.
Notes can contain text and an optional image, which is displayed within the note's content.
## Validation and Security:
- The script checks if the image URL is allowed based on a configured list of permitted URLs.
It validates the note's text length, ensuring it does not exceed the set limit (1000 characters), with an option to configure this limit.
## Animations:
- While writing and reading a note, the player performs appropriate animations, enhancing realism and immersion.
These animations are linked to specific in-game objects (notebooks).
## Limits:
- Maximum number of notes at a time: 10 (configurable)
- Maximum note length: 1000 characters (configurable)
## Allowed Image URLs:
- imgur.com
- cdn.discordapp.com
(More can be added in the config)
## Animations:
- Writing and reading animations are based on the "prop_notepad_01" object and corresponding animations, ensuring visual consistency and a realistic feel.
